 - Ruby port by starrhorne and iterationlabs
 - Python port by gfxmonk ( https://github.com/gfxmonk/python-readability , based on BeautifulSoup )
 - Decruft effort to move to lxml ( http://www.minvolai.com/blog/decruft-arc90s-readability-in-python/ )
 - "BR to P" fix from readability.js which improves quality for smaller texts.
